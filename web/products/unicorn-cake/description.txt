This unicorn cake will be the star of your next birthday celebration, baby shower, and more! The funfetti cake itself has a light and tender crumb with a mild vanilla flavor. Itâ€™s frosted in a light and silky smooth vanilla buttercream and then decorated with rainbow swirls over the top and back to resemble a unicorn mane, with eyes, horns, and ears!
